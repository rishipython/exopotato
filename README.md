# exopotato
Exopotato is a software for deep space exoplanet hunting made using machine learning. It uses change in flux (light frequency) data to determine if a star is orbitted by an exoplanet. It is trained on a dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/keplersmachines/kepler-labelled-time-series-data), which has rougly ~5000 datapoints for the training set, with each datapoint having 1397 change in flux values and a label identifying it as either having or not having an exoplanet. On the testing set, it obtained an accuracy of 98%. The UI is made with a website that uses Django, HTML, and CSS. The UI will allow the user to upload a .csv file with the change in flux data and will output whether or not it has an exoplanet and will show a graph of the change in flux data.
